A fun and interactive 2D shooting game built using vanilla JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API. Shoot incoming enemies, score points, and survive as long as you can!

## Game Mechanics

- The **player** is positioned at the center of the screen.
- **Click** anywhere on the screen to fire a projectile in that direction.
- **Enemies** spawn at random locations off-screen and move toward the player.
- Hitting an enemy reduces its size or destroys it, depending on its radius.
- Destroying or shrinking enemies increases your score.
- The game ends when an enemy collides with the player.
